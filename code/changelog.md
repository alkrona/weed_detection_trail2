<h1> Stuff that happened today</h1>
successfully utilized and downloaded the image dataset of weeds collected and trained by the ribsworth institute.
<br>
Started creating the simulation, decided to implement field as objects with 4 attributes namely x_axis value, y_axis value , is_sprayed conditinal and the label corresponing to that field;
<br>
Which can be either normal land, plant or weed.
<br>
Repo of the project has been created
<h2> Things to be done for the future </h2>
Need to implement live video tracking with the pretrained data set.
<br>
Path planning algorithm has to be implemented, and an array which contains the sequence of locations has to be made.
<br>
<br>
A checker has to be implemented that can check weather the area of interest at that particular time of the frame data of the image has any weeds in it.
<br>
<br>
Web representation of the large grid which shows the vehicle along with a small view of the field of interest needs to be shown on a html page.
